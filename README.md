Build Ssmtp on Raspbian and Debian Buster

A once popular smtp agent, [sSMTP](https://wiki.debian.org/sSMTP), is no longer maintained for debian-based systems (Buster and later), including Raspbian. Included in this repo are additional dpkg build files and patches to the [debian package repo for sSMTP](https://salsa.debian.org/debian/ssmtp) so that it can be built for Buster (and later).
